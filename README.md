This project applies a K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) classifier to the Wisconsin Diagnostic Breast Cancer (WDBC) dataset. It includes preprocessing steps such as feature scaling and encoding using ColumnTransformer and Pipeline, followed by cross-validation with StratifiedKFold to optimize the number of neighbors based on the F1-score. The final model evaluates classification performance on a held-out test set.
